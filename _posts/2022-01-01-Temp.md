> Abstract: In this post, we are going to look deep into policy gradient, why it works, and many new policy gradient algorithms proposed in recent years: vanilla policy gradient, actor-critic, off-policy actor-critic, A3C, A2C, DPG, DDPG, D4PG, MADDPG, TRPO, PPO, ACER, ACTKR, SAC, TD3 & SVPG.

## What is Policy Gradient

Policy gradient is an approach to solve reinforcement learning problems. If you haven't looked into the field of reinforcement learning, please first read the section ["A (Long) Peek into Reinforcement Learning >> Key Concepts"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2018-02-19-a-long-peek-into-reinforcement-learning %}#key-concepts) for the problem definition and key concepts.
