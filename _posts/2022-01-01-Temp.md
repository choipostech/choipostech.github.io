My goal is to upload materials every week in 2022. So, I organized some topics of Operations Research and the result is like below:
* Introduction (Problem Solving with Models)
* Basics of Linear Programming (with Geometry)
* Simplex Method (includes Revised form)
* Dual Simplex Method (with Duality)
* Sensitivity Analysis (Post-optimality)
* Bounded Variable Technique
* Multiobjective Optimization
* Large Scale Optimization
* Various Algorithms for solving LP (with Complexity)
* Interior Point Method
* Spanning Trees / Arborescenes
* Shortest Paths (with Primal-Dual Scheme)
* Network Flows (with Primal-Dual Scheme)
* Min-cost Flows (with Primal-Dual Scheme)
* Maximum Matching
* Weighted Matching
* b-matchings / t-joins
* Matroids
* Generalization of Matroids
* Approximation and Fitting Algorithms
* Knapsack Problem
* Bin-Packing Problem
