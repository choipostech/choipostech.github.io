## Brief explanation about Operations Research
### Brief History of OR
 Operations Research is a discipline whose origin lies in the war, especially the Second World War. During that war, scientists/researchers of England were gathered, and they had tried to get stretegical tactics to be used directly in the war. For instance, efficient ocean transport, effective bombing were the part of the problems they had struggled. As many of you already knows, this project was so successful that other countries like US also had made this kind of team. <p>
 After that, although the warfare had terminated, these academic outcomes did not limited to the war. Industrial managers and executives were interested in applying these methods, and those trials made the industry more efficient. Currently, OR is widely used throughout numerous industires that we could not easily find out the area which not using OR. Therefore, I think OR is an <b>active, changeable</b> academic discipline and also OR has infinite possibility because it would be combined with other disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, and also laws. The more industrial problems emerges, the more things we need to study and find out emerge. So, let's dig in and study hard to make our own models or algorithms and eventually have chance to contribute to our society positively. 
 
> Operations Research is the application of the methods of science to complex problems in the direction and management of large systems of men, machines, materials and money in industry, business and defence. The purpose is to help management to determine its policy and actions scientifically. [Operational Research Society, UK (1971)]  

### Main Phases of OR
If we conduct OR project, we could generalize some steps we take into 5 phases (According to the type of the problem, it could be different). 
* Phase 1 - Formulation of the Problem 
* Phase 2 - Construction of a Mathematical Model
* Phase 3 - Deriving a Solution from the Model
* Phase 4 - Testing the Model and the Solution
* Phase 5 - Implementing the Solution

  		As we can easily see above, the model we use is one of the most important thing using OR approach. Though we know some disadvantages of modeling such as validality issues of simplified models, but still, modeling has enormous power to interpret some problems.
